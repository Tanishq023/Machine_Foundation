# Machine_Foundation
This project focuses on the design and construction of RCC machine foundations for heavy industrial equipment, specifically transformer handling systems. It reflects practical insights gained during industrial training at BHEL Bhopal, covering key aspects of civil execution in an industrial setting.

The scope includes:

Structural layout planning of raft and pedestal foundations

Application of vibration-resistant design principles

Reinforcement detailing and anchoring techniques

Template alignment using laser levels and theodolites

Observations on quality control, safety measures, and IS code compliance
The foundation system is engineered to ensure long-term structural integrity, vibration isolation, and precise load transfer, while maintaining positional accuracy and dimensional stability under continuous dynamic loading in a high-performance industrial environment.
